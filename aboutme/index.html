    <h2>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>
    <p>My name is Titus Okorie and I am currently in Fall 2023 first semester. I was born, raised and currently living in Nigeria.</p>
    <p>I am happily married andwe are blessed with three lovely daughters. I completed my the Pathway Connect Course 2 months ago</p>
    <p>and got enrolled into BYU-Idaho to study Software Development, and I have thoroughly enjoyed myself here. BYUI is a great</p>
    <p>institution.  The instructors, students and staff are fantastic and the atmosphere is one that makes one really want to learn</p><br>
    <p>I am not currently working, but seriously looking to land a Junior Frontend Developer Job at the end of this semester</p>
    <p>Web Development as a career has many benefits to offer, one is that it gives me the opportunity to express myself creatively </p>
    <p>on the internet. Also, Web Developers are in high demand in the labour market, and taking up this course will give me</p>
    <p>the ability to work in various work environment that permits career growth and opportunities for innovation and invention </p>
    <p>and at thesame time learning transferable skills.  The benefits are enormous</p>
    <br><p>I joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints barely 3 months ago. My favourite quote from Prophet Joseph Smith </p>
    <p> is "I have no enemies but for the truth's sake.  I have no desire but to do all men good.  I feel to pray for all men.  We don't</p>
    <p> ask any people to throw away any good they have got; we only ask them to come and get more"  My favourite scripture is Mathew 7:7</p>
    <br><p>I am an interesting, fun loving guy with a good sense of humor. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at first I</p>
    <p>come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. It is hard </p>
    <p> for me to make friends but once I make them, itâ€™s great and I am all different. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much</p>
    <p> as I give. I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive guy as my close friends will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I </p>
    <p>am soft. I am also a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am also a very straight and honest person.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking your precious time to look at my web page</p>
